# Intelligent Pi Camera üì∏

An intelligent, people recognising camera module for the Raspberry Pi,
powered by Deep Learning Models. This JVM application wraps a Deep Learning model
and gets inferences from it in real time (every 1000 milliseconds). 
Since this application (with the DL model) is to be deployed onto the same hardware
(Raspberry Pi) as a presumably high-definition camera, it is highly recommended that you have at least 4 GB of memory.

### How it works:
This containerised JVM application stays afloat 24x7.
It shoots a picture every 1000<sup>th</sup> millisecond and feeds into the model for inference.
When the model recognises an object that it's supposed to be looking for (ex: a person), the application
triggers a notification to the user with the respective photograph. The detection, however, is limited 
only to the objects the model onboard can recognise.
